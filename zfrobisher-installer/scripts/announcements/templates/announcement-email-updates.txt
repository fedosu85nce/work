Updating IBM PowerKVM Packages from internal repositories

You can update your existing IBM PowerKVM @PKVM_STREAM@ system with the latest development IBM PowerKVM rpm
packages.

Updates are available through GSA repository for IBM
PowerKVM. If your system has direct access to it, you can use Yum. In
case it does not, use the ibm-update-system utility, as instructed
below.

Before you update IBM PowerKVM, power off any guest virtual machines
and stop any workloads. You are required to restart your system after
you apply any updates.

To update your existing IBM PowerKVM @PKVM_STREAM@ using yum, follow these steps:

     Make sure your system has connectivity to pokgsa.ibm.com, from within PowerKVM host.
     Download repository file:
         # wget http://pokgsa.ibm.com/projects/p/pkvm-updates/devel/IBM/powerkvm-devel.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/powerkvm-devel.repo
     Use the yum command to produce a list of available updates. For example:
         # yum update
     Review the list of packages and enter Y if you agree.

To update your existing IBM PowerKVM @PKVM_STREAM@ using the ibm-update-system utility, follow these
steps:

     Download the IBM PowerKVM update ISO image from
     @ISO_URL@
     and upload this ISO image to your PowerKVM system, in a location of your
     choice.

     Run the following command:
         # ibm-udpate-system --iso-path=path_to_file

     Replace path_to_file with the path to the ISO file containing the updates.
     Review the packages marked for update, and agree by entering Y.
