    Updating IBM PowerKVM Packages from internal repositories

    You can update your existing IBM PowerKVM @PKVM_STREAM@ system with the latest development IBM PowerKVM rpm
    packages in two forms.

    Updates are available through GSA repository for IBM
    PowerKVM. If your system has direct access to it, you can use Yum. In
    case it does not, use the ibm-update-system utility, as instructed
    below.

    Before you update IBM PowerKVM, power off any guest virtual machines
    and stop any workloads. You are required to restart your system after
    you apply any updates.

    (Option 2a) To update your existing IBM PowerKVM @PKVM_STREAM@ using yum, follow these steps:
    
        a) Make sure your system has connectivity to
           pokgsa.ibm.com, from within PowerKVM host.
        b) Download repository file:
           # wget
http://pokgsa.ibm.com/projects/p/pkvm-updates/devel/IBM/powerkvm-devel.repo
-O /etc/yum.repos.d/powerkvm-devel.repo
        c) Use the yum command to produce a list of available
           updates. For example:
           # yum update
        d) Review the list of packages and enter Y if you agree.

    (Option 2b) To update your existing IBM PowerKVM @PKVM_STREAM@ using the ibm-update-system utility, follow
    these steps:

        a) Download the IBM PowerKVM update ISO image from
           @ISO_URL@
           and upload this ISO image to your PowerKVM system, in a
           location of your choice.
        b) Run the following command:
           # ibm-udpate-system --iso-path=path_to_file
           (Replace path_to_file with the path to the ISO file
           containing the updates.)
        c) Review the packages marked for update, and agree by
           entering Y.
