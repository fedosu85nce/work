	Global initialized variables and static initialized variables are stored in
	.data segment together. global uninitialized and static uninitialized
	variables are stored in .bss segment together near the initialized ones, and
	may not take space. Local variables do not take space and will be stored in
	stack while running.

	The default size of stack in GCC is 8MB, verified by `ulimit -s`.
