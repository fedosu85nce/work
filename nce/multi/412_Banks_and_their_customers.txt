#  412 Banks and their customers

When anyone opens a current account at a bank, he is lending the bank money,
repayment of which he may demand at any time, either in cash or by drawing
checks in favor of another person. Primarily, the bank-customer relationship is
that of debtor and creditor -- who is which depending on whether the customer's
account is in credit or is overdrawn. But, in addition to that basically simple
concept, the bank and its customers owe a large number of obligations to one
another. Many of these obligations can give rise to problems and complications
but a bank customer, unlike, say, a buyer of goods, can not complain that the
law is loaded against him.

The bank must obey its customer's instructions, and not those of anyone else.
When, for example, a customer first opens an account, he instructs the bank to
debit his account only in respect of checks drawn by himself. He gives the bank
specimens of his signature, and there is a very firm rule that the bank has no
right or authority to pay out a customer's money on a check on which its
customer's signature has been forged.  It makes no difference that the forgery
may have been a very skillful one: the bank must recognize its customer's
signature. For this reason there is no risk to the customer in the practice,
adopted by banks, of printing the customer's name on his checks. If this
facilitates forgery, it is the bank which will lose, not the customer.
